## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
In the Semantic Web community,
we focus on how to best interlink data so data relations can be discovered
and various data sources can be combined such that the result is more than the sum of its parts.
Unfortunately there are still many areas where the semantic interlinking of data is sorely lacking.
Even not all data published by researchers is semantically annotated,
which can limit the growth rate of the Semantic Web.
<!-- Need         -->
One of these areas is the publication of research experiment results.
Quite often when publishing new research ideas,
this is accompanied by an evaluation of this idea,
proving how this new idea compares to the current state of the art in a multitude of dimensions.
However, these results are rarely published in such a way
that the actual results can easily be re-used for meta-research or further investigation.
<!-- Task         -->
To this end we designed a way to semantically describe both research results
and the configuration used to generate them,
allowing other researchers to easily query those
and combine them with other results.
<!-- Object       -->
More specifically,
we provide a way to semantically describe the building blocks of an implementation in JSON-LD.
Additionally, we provide a semantically annotated dataset of the entire npm package library,
allowing for semantic interlinking between packages.
<!-- Findings     -->
<!-- Conclusion   -->
We believe that this will help future researchers wanting to compare research results
or looking for solutions that best match their needs.
