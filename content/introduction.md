## Introduction
Too many computer science articles
that contain experimental software evaluations
identify that software only by name and, sometimes, version number.
This information is insufficient for readers
to understand which _exact_ version of the software,
which exact versions of its _dependencies_,
and which detailed _configuration_ of the software's components
has in fact obtained the reported results.
Therefore, potential users cannot necessarily obtain the correct software installation
that will behave according to the article's conclusions.
Moreover, other researchers might fail
in reproducing the same results
because of differences in any of these aspects.

Write paragraph about the importance of reproducibility,
and that this is related to documenting and publishing all experimental conditions
(zooming out from software to general conditions).

Write paragraph about how Linked Data is an excellent means
of describing experimental conditions, pointing to the diagram.

Explain that we will focus on describing software configurations
used for an experiment.

AÂ _research article_ is based on _result data_,
which are the outcomes of an _experiment_.
The experiment in turn also has (multiple) provenance chains,
and this article focuses on _software configurations_ and _software modules_.
