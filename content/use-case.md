[Linked Data Fragments](cite:citesAsAuthority verborgh_jws_2016)

We have implemented a new version of the [LDF server](https://github.com/LinkedDataFragments/Server.js/tree/feature-lsd)
where all components are dynamically wired by Components.js.
We semantically describe the LDF server module and its 32 components, which results in x triples.
The configuration file used to be a [JSON file](https://github.com/LinkedDataFragments/Server.js/blob/master/config/config-example.json)
with a custom domain-specific language.
Now, this [configuration file](https://github.com/LinkedDataFragments/Server.js/blob/feature-lsd/config/config-example.json) is a declarative components file that can be understood by Components.js,.
This new configuration format has two major advantages:

* The configuration file is RDF data with a semantic meaning.
* External components can be injected by including declaratively into the config file.

The workflow for the experiment setup is as follows:

1. Design experiment execution and workflow (DIO, OPMW, P-Plan)
2. Environment setup
3. Retrieve software module and RDFise
4. RDFise software configuration
5. ?
6. Create dataset structure (RDF Data Cube, SKOS)
7. ?
8. Run experiment
9. Catch and store results data (RDF Data Cube)
10. Create visualisation and analysis

Activities, entities and actors are defined and captured at each workflow step using PROV-O.
