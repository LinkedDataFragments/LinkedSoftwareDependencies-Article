## Overview of software experiment descriptions
{:#overview}

The correct description of experimental evaluations has many aspects.
In this article, we focus on those aspects related to the description of software,
of which we provide an overview in [](#software-aspects).
We then describe in [](#workflow) how these aspects fit
into a generic workflow of describing experimental setups.

### Aspects of software-based research

This section will shortly introduce each of the blocks in the diagram.
Ruben V. will write the basis.

Mention somewhere here that we will use JSON-LD syntax for the examples in this paper.

### Workflow to describe experimental setups
{:#workflow}

A possible workflow for describing experimental setups is as follows:

1. Design experiment execution and workflow (DIO, OPMW, P-Plan)
2. Environment setup
3. Retrieve software module and RDFise
4. RDFise software configuration
5. ?
6. Create dataset structure (RDF Data Cube, SKOS)
7. ?
8. Run experiment
9. Catch and store results data (RDF Data Cube)
10. Create visualisation and analysis

Activities, entities and actors are defined and captured at each workflow step using PROV-O.
