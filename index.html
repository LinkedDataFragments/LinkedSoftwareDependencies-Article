    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <!-- Context      -->
    <p>The scientific process requires reproducible experiments and findings
to foster trust and accountability.
Within computer science engineering,
reproducing experiments involves setting up
the exact same software with the same benchmarks and test data,
which often requires non-trivial manual work.
<!-- Need         -->
Unfortunately,
many research articles ambiguously refer to software by name only,
leaving out crucial details such as module and dependency version numbers
or the configuration of the individual components.
<!-- Task         -->
To this end, we created vocabularies
for the semantic description of software components and their configuration,
which can be published as Linked Data alongside experimental results.
We implemented a dependency injection framework
to accurately instantiate these described experimental configurations.
<!-- Object       -->
This article discusses the approach and its application,
and explains with a use case
how to publish experiments and their software configurations on the Web.
<!-- Findings     -->
In order to enable semantic interlinking between configurations and modules,
we published the metadata of all 475,000+ JavaScript libraries on npm
as 150,000,000+ RDF triples.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
Through our work,
research articles can refer by URL
to fine-grained, instantiatable descriptions of experimental setups,
completing the provenance chain from
specifications to implementations, dependencies, and configurations
all the way to experimental results.
This ultimately brings faster and more accurate reproductions of experiments,
and facilitates the evaluation of new research contributions.
<!-- Perspectives -->
Moreover, this work can serve other use cases,
such as general software instantiation outside of experiments,
and query execution over software configuration metadata.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Too many computer science articles
that contain experimental software evaluations
identify that software only by name and, sometimes, version number.
This information is insufficient for readers
to understand which <em>exact</em> version of the software,
which exact versions of its <em>dependencies</em>,
and which detailed <em>configuration</em> of the software’s components
has in fact obtained the reported results.
Therefore, potential users cannot necessarily obtain the correct software installation
that will behave according to the article’s conclusions.
Moreover, other researchers might fail
in reproducing the same results
because of differences in any of these aspects.</p>

    <p>As <a property="http://purl.org/spar/cito/providesQuotationFor" href="http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~donoho/Reports/1995/wavelab.pdf">Claerbout’s Principle</a> <a class="reference" href="#ref-1">[1]</a> explains,
<q>an article about computational science in a scientific publication
is not the scholarship itself, it is merely <strong>advertising</strong> of the scholarship.
The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment
and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.</q>
This stresses the importance of reproducibility,
and essentially mandates a detailed description
of the executed experiment, the involved artefacts and actors,
and the processing of the retrieved data.</p>

    <p>Using Linked Data to publish such descriptions provides two immediate benefits:
the experimental setup and parts thereof can be <em>identified with IRIs</em>,
and their details can be retrieved by <em>dereferencing those IRIs</em>.
Therefore, if research articles complement their textual explanation of an experiment
with the IRI of the full setup, reproducibility is guaranteed.
Moreover, the IRIs of the entire experiment or its parts
can be reused in other articles or experiment
to unambiguously refer to the same conditions.
<a href="#description-diagram">Fig. 1</a> illustrates how this leads to a chain of provenance
from the research article to the data
and the experiment that generates it,
and all the aspects surrounding that experiment.</p>

    <figure id="description-diagram">

<figcaption>
        <p>A <em>research article</em> is based on <em>result data</em>,
which are the outcomes of an <em>experiment</em>.
The experiment in turn also has (multiple) provenance chains,
and this article focuses on <em>software configurations</em> and <em>software modules</em>.</p>
      </figcaption>
</figure>

    <p>In this article,
we focus on the description of <em>software configurations</em> and <em>software modules</em>,
such that an evaluated software setup
can be referred to unambiguously by an IRI.
We thereby avoid the inherent vagueness
of referring to software by name only.
We further facilitate the reproduction of experiments
through a mechanisms that automatically <em>instantiates</em> the software configuration
based on its Linked Data description.
Our contributions are the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the RDF-based description of <strong>software modules</strong>,
applied to the 475,000+ bundles of the npm ecosystem for Node.js;</li>
      <li>the RDF-based description of <strong>available components</strong> within software modules;</li>
      <li>the RDF-based description of a <strong>precise configuration</strong> of software modules;</li>
      <li>the <strong>automated instantiation</strong> of such a configuration;</li>
      <li>a <strong>use case</strong> that explains the usage of the resulting Linked Data
in a scientific article.</li>
    </ul>
