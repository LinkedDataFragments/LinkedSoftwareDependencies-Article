    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <!-- Context      -->
    <p>The scientific process requires reproducible or replicable experiments and
findings in order to foster trust and accountability. In the domain of computer
science engineering, reproducing experiments involves setting up the exact same
software with the same benchmarks and test data.
<!-- Need         -->
Unfortunately,
many research articles ambiguously refer to software by name only,
leaving out crucial details such as package and dependency version numbers
or the configuration of the individual components—all of which are necessary to
reproduce experiments. Moreover, the granularity and richness of the
accompanying data makes it feasible to conduct tractable evaluations and
benchmarking.
<!-- Task         -->
Therefore,
we designed JSON-LD-based software configurations
which can be published as Linked Data alongside experimental results,
and implemented a dependency injection framework
that can instantiate such experimental setups faithfully.
<!-- Object       -->
This article discusses the approach,
applies it to the npm ecosystem,
and explains how to publish software configurations on the Web.
<!-- Findings     -->
In order to make configurations such fully dereferenceable,
we published the metadata of all 470,000 JavaScript libraries on npm
as 150,000,000 RDF triples.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
Through our work,
research articles can precisely refer to experimental setups
using the URL of an instantiatable configuration,
completing the provenance chain from
specifications to implementations, dependencies, and configurations
all the way to experimental results.
This ultimately brings faster and more accurate replications of experiments,
and facilitates the evaluation of new research contributions.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Too many computer science articles
that contain experimental software evaluations
identify that software only by name and, sometimes, version number.
This information is insufficient for readers
to understand which <em>exact</em> version of the software,
which exact versions of its <em>dependencies</em>,
and which detailed <em>configuration</em> of the software’s components
has in fact obtained the reported results.
Therefore, potential users cannot necessarily obtain the correct software installation
that will behave according to the article’s conclusions.
Moreover, other researchers might fail
in reproducing the same results
because of differences in any of these aspects.</p>

    <p>As <a property="http://purl.org/spar/cito/providesQuotationFor" href="http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~donoho/Reports/1995/wavelab.pdf">Claerbout’s Principle</a> <a class="reference" href="#ref-1">[1]</a> explains,
<q>an article about computational science in a scientific publication
is not the scholarship itself, it is merely <strong>advertising</strong> of the scholarship.
The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment
and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.</q>
This stresses the importance of reproducibility,
and essentially mandates a detailed description
of the executed experiment, the involved artefacts and actors,
and the processing of the retrieved data.</p>

    <p class="todo">Write paragraph about how Linked Data is an excellent means
of describing experimental conditions, pointing to the diagram.</p>

    <p class="todo">Explain that we will focus on describing software configurations
used for an experiment.</p>

        <p>A <em>research article</em> is based on <em>result data</em>,
which are the outcomes of an <em>experiment</em>.
The experiment in turn also has (multiple) provenance chains,
and this article focuses on <em>software configurations</em> and <em>software modules</em>.</p>
